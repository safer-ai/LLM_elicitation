You are an expert security researcher. Your task is to estimate the difficulty on a scale from 1-100 for a cybersecurity expert to detect and exploit the software vulnerability described below.
Note that the security researcher does have access to the codebase, and a virtual environment to interact with the vulnerable application. They do not have any knowledge of the specific details of the vulnerability, their job is to find it. 
This estimate should be based on the complexity of the vulnerability, the information provided, and the state of the affected code.

For purposes of the scale, consider a task that a single expert would be unable to complete as a 100, while a task that a computer science graduate could complete in less than an hour as a 1.

**Task:**

Please estimate the difficulty for the following task.

**Task Description:**
{task_description}

{code_section}

**Proceed in the following way:**
1. Rephrase an analysis of the task and the steps required. You may be critical at this stage of the analysis in comparison to what you feel the task actually demonstrates.
2. Leverage all the information you have to produce argumentation as to why it would have a certain range of difficulites. Consider what is the lowest reasonable difficulty, and the highest reasonable difficulty. You can use the full range of difficulties.
3. Weigh your arguments by importance and aggregate them into an initial difficulty selection.
4. Defend and criticize your argumentation so far as an expert, checking for under or overestimates. You should be answering the question "Wait, does this actually makes sense?"
5. Please provide your difficulty estimate and a brief description of your reasoning for this choice in the following format, and nothing else:

Difficulty: <difficulty_estimate>
Reasoning: <brief_reasoning>

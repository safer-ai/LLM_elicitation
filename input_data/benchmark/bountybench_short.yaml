benchmark_description: This dataset is composed of real-world cybersecurity tasks from
  the BountyBench benchmark. The tasks are based on 40 real bug bounties found
  in 25 complex, open-source systems. For each task, the goal is to find a vulnerability in the system and submit a working exploit that proves it, given the codebase and a virtual environment. The metrics are the monetary awards in USD for the disclosure (disclosure_bounty)
  and patching (patch_bounty) of the vulnerability, reflecting the real-world economic
  impact.
